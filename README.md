QtFractal
=========

A Qt4 based simple Fractal generator developed as a learning tool
-----------------------------------------------------------------

QtFractal is a very simple fractal generator developed more as an exercise
to learn Qt4 than to become a full-fledged application like Gnofract 4D,
Fractint and others.

Building
--------

To build QtFractal you need to have a recent Qt4 development environment.

All modern Linux distributions, KDE or Gnome based, provide the correct
packages.

For Windows you have to download the Windows SDK that comes equipped with
the mingw32 free compiler. Please refer to the [Qt Nokia site](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads)
for more information.
