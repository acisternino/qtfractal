QtFractal
=========

A Qt4 based simple Fractal generator developed as a learning tool
-----------------------------------------------------------------

QtFractal is a very simple fractal generator developed as an exercise
to learn Qt4. It is not a full-fledged fractal rendering application like
Gnofract 4D, Fractint and others.

Heavily influenced by the great tutorial at Nokia:
[mandelbrot](http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/threads-mandelbrot.html)

Building
--------

To build QtFractal you need to have a recent Qt4 development environment.

All modern Linux distributions, KDE or Gnome based, provide the correct
packages.

For Windows you have to download the Windows SDK that comes equipped with
the mingw32 free compiler. Please refer to the [Qt Nokia site](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads)
for more information.
