TODO list
=========

What follows is a generic list of the features I would like to evaluate 
and possibily add to QtFractal.

STRATEGY
--------

1. A lot more documentation and comments (using Doxygen)
2. Move algorithms to a few dedicate classes
3. Use threads to create the image
4. Improve the GUI using a QMainWindow
4. Add palettes and a simple algorithm to use them
5. Add Flame Fractal algorithm
6. Add CUDA support

DETAILS
-------

* Improve handling of resize events on compositing WM's on Linux
* Add command line options
* Improve logging
* Add a lot more details on how to build QtFractal on Linux and Windows
* Find a suitable icon
